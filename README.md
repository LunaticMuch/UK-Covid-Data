#  UK Covid Data Dashboard

## Description

This application allows to see the latest COVID statistics provided on daily basis by the [UK Government Coronavirus statistics website](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk). I created this application as a learning project for building SwiftUI application (and iOS application in general).

## ChartView

The chart is engine is based on a customised version (out from the new version 2 beta) of [ChartView library](https://github.com/AppPear/ChartView). A preview of version 2 is available as [demo application](https://github.com/AppPear/ChartViewV2Demo). The reason for customisation is because of the library project appearing to be stale and incomplete. The demo shows functonality not available, or partially completed.
